## [Unreleased]

## [1.5.0] - 2026-08-24

### Added

- **Versioned report model**: Added the validated `report-model.json` contract, generated JSON Schema and TypeScript declarations, source-aware data-quality metadata, safe links, explicit missing/suppressed/error sections, and fixture-driven field parity coverage for every analyzer adapter.
- **Local dashboard**: Added the Preact dashboard and local-only FastAPI service with safe run discovery, run selection, static report reuse, sortable and searchable analyzer views, keyboard match navigation, accessible native expansion, and report-model compatibility errors.
- **Live observation mode**: Added bounded source snapshot polling, atomic promotion, debounced reanalysis, persisted checkpoints, last-known-good reports, health/status APIs, and SSE revision updates for Mythic, Ghostwriter, Cobalt Strike REST, and Outflank sources.
- **Release validation**: Added complete Python, frontend, and Go CI gates plus production-image smoke coverage for static report generation and served dashboard APIs.

### Changed

- **Report generation**: Static HTML reports now embed the same validated model and compiled dashboard used by served mode.
- **Server lifecycle**: Live workers use FastAPI lifespan management for deterministic startup and shutdown.

### Fixed

- Ordinary non-live served reports no longer open a live event stream or display a false degraded connection state.
- Live refreshes remain pinned to the selected run, and table sorting uses raw numeric values rather than formatted duration or percentage text.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-23

### Added

- **Run Diff Command**: Added `janus-cli diff` / `janus diff` to compare a baseline run with a candidate run, emit deterministic `diff.json`, render comparison results through the standard `report.html` flow, and classify command-level regressions/improvements with confidence and comparability warnings.
- **Parser Quality Dashboard**: Added a report **Data Quality** section and structured `bundle.json` `data_quality` entries so parser/source fidelity is visible per source, including skipped records, invalid timestamps, fallback task IDs, status distributions, retention modes, parser malformed-count metadata, and confidence warnings for limited analysis categories.
- **Friction Score Analyzer**: Added `friction-score`, a command ranking analyzer that combines failure rate, retry density, retry-to-success behavior, duration, callback health, and argument anomaly signals to surface the highest-friction commands in an operation.
- **Friction score recommendation registry**: Added `Config/friction_score_registry.yml` and `Core/friction_score_registry.py` so action recommendations can be managed by rule, including suppression and fallback behavior for commands where friction does not necessarily imply an automation candidate.
- **Friction score configuration**: Added `friction_score` weights, sample confidence thresholds, and duration caps to the analyzer behavior registry so scoring can be tuned without code changes.

### Changed

- **Analyzer behavior registry**: Updated registry loading and metadata export to include friction score configuration.
- **HTML report**: Added friction score output rendering so reports display top friction candidates, component metrics, confidence, and recommendation metadata.
- **Core I/O and output formats**: Updated bundle/output handling and existing analyzer integration points to carry friction score metadata and emit `friction-score.json` alongside the other analyzer artifacts.
- **Analyzer internals**: Reduced duplicated analyzer dispatch and event-indexing logic by consolidating analyzer execution in `janus.py` and shared task/result helpers in `Core/event_utils.py`, preserving CLI behavior and analyzer output schemas.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Outflank implant log ingest**: Added a local Outflank parser for line-oriented implant log files. The parser normalizes `task_request` / `task_response` records into Janus task and result events, derives stable numeric IDs from Outflank UIDs, tracks implant/log parsing metadata, infers simple result status, and writes standard `events.ndjson` / `bundle.json` artifacts with output and argument retention rules applied.

## [1.0.4] - 2026-04-24

### Added

- **Configurable Mythic response pagination**: Added `--response-page-size` for Mythic `pull` / `run` workflows and `mythic.response_page_size` in config so large `response_text` rows can be pulled with smaller GraphQL pages. Pull metadata now records the resolved `responses_page_size`.

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-23

### Changed

- **Mythic response pagination hardening**: Janus now fetches Mythic `response` rows in smaller GraphQL pages (`response.id` cursor, ascending order, 500 rows per request) instead of issuing one unbounded operation-wide response query. This reduces the chance of Hasura/Postgres out-of-memory failures when pulling long engagements with large command output while preserving the existing normalized output and CLI behavior.

## [1.0.2] — 2026-04-22

### Added

- **Mythic PTY provenance fields**: PTY session, transport, and synthetic shell-line events now emit first-class schema fields instead of hiding PTY metadata in retention dictionaries. New task fields include `pty_session`, `pty_transport_event`, `pty_parent_task_id`, `pty_input_task_id`, `pty_sequence`, `pty_input_raw`, `pty_input_message_ids`, `pty_child_count`, and `pty_interactive_message_count`. New result fields include `pty_sequence`, `pty_output_message_ids`, `pty_output_preface`, `pty_exit_observed`, `pty_exit_timestamp`, and `pty_exit_code`.
- **Interactive PTY message attribution**: Synthetic PTY task/result pairs now preserve source interactive message IDs for input and output rows, use per-session sequence numbers, and timestamp synthetic results from observed output or exit messages when available.
- **PTY exit capture**: Mythic interactive stream parsing now records observed PTY exit messages, exit timestamps, and integer exit codes when the exit payload parses cleanly.

### Changed

- **PTY retention handling**: `arguments_rule` now clears `pty_input_raw` alongside `arguments_raw`; `output_rule` now clears `pty_output_preface` alongside `output_text`, preserving privacy expectations for PTY-specific content.
- **PTY architecture docs**: The normalized event model now documents PTY-specific task and result fields so downstream consumers can rely on the emitted schema.

## [1.0.1] — 2026-04-20

### Added

- **Mythic PTY-aware ingest**: Interactive PTY sessions keep the parent `pty` launch task; in-session commands are normalized as synthetic task/result pairs (negative `task_id`, metadata such as `pty_synthetic`, `pty_parent_task_id`, `pty_input_task_id`). Optional GraphQL query for Hasura `interactive` rows when exposed; otherwise child `pty` UI task rows are parsed from `original_params`. Bundle metadata includes `pty_interactive_query_available`.
- **PTY nested command grouping for analyzers**: Tasks with `pty_synthetic` roll up under the logical bucket **`pty_in_session`** (not under bare `cd` / `pwd` / `ls`, etc.) so session-scaled timings do not skew standalone command stats. Duration rows and HTML can carry **`pty_shell_command`** for the real shell line. Registry adds Mythic **`pty_in_session`** with `command_duration.mode: exclude_from_friction` alongside **`pty`**.
- **Argument position profile**: PTY in-session lines use per-shell keys **`pty_in_session::<shell>`** (e.g. `pty_in_session::cd`) so the per-command breakdown is interpretable; HTML labels them as **PTY ▸ (shell)** with an explanatory note when present.
- **Analyzer registry**: Mythic `pty` uses `command_duration.mode: exclude_from_friction` so session lifetime is not treated as operator friction.
- **Tests**: `Tests/test_mythic_pty_ingest.py` and fixtures under `Tests/fixtures/mythic_pty/`.

### Changed

- **`command_duration` analyzer**: Registry exclusion for friction metrics now applies whenever `command_duration.mode` is `exclude_from_friction` (not only when paired with `expected_sleep_or_delay`), so registry-only rules such as Mythic `pty` / `pty_in_session` take effect. PTY synthetics bucket separately; **`pty_shell_command`** is preserved on **`max_event`** and outlier rows for JSON and HTML.
- **Other analyzers**: `command_failure_summary`, `argument_position_profile`, `parameter_entropy`, `command_retry_success` (PTY groups use operation + shell command), `dwell_time`, and `outlier_context` use the same PTY grouping rules where they key by command name.
- **HTML report**: Duration max/outlier command text shows nested PTY lines as `pty_in_session → …` via `_format_duration_row_command`; the duration table’s **pty_in_session** row can show **slowest line: …** from the max event.

### Repository

- **`.gitignore`**: Ignore common testing/coverage artifacts (e.g. `.pytest_cache/`, `.coverage`, `htmlcov/`), local `.venv/`, and build metadata (`*.egg-info/`, `build/`).

### Mythic — refreshing data after an upgrade

Older `events.ndjson` / bundles do not gain PTY normalization retroactively. To ingest with the new parser and analyzers:

1. Use this Janus tree (or rebuild/install your CLI from it).
2. In **Config/janus.yml**, set **`mythic.endpoint`**, **`mythic.api_token`**, and **`mythic.operation_id`** (numeric ID of the operation in Mythic). Adjust **`mythic.verify_tls`** if you use self-signed HTTPS.
3. Run a **full pull** for that operation, e.g. `./janus-cli run --source mythic --operation-id <id>` (or rely on `mythic.operation_id` in config if your CLI supports it). This rewrites `out/.../events.ndjson`, `bundle.json`, and analyzer outputs.
4. In **`bundle.json`**, check **`pty_interactive_query_available`**: `true` means Hasura exposed the `interactive` query; `false` is OK — ingest still uses PTY child tasks and parent `stdout`/`stderr` where present.
